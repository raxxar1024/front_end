"""
Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words,
determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.
You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

For example, given
s = "leetcode",
dict = ["leet", "code"].

Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".

UPDATE (2017/1/4):
The wordDict parameter had been changed to a list of strings (instead of a set of strings).
Please reload the code definition to get the latest changes.
